      <h1>Tips to learn new Languages</h1>
      <h2> Find here 5 useful tips to learn any new language. </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Practice
              <p> 
                Learning a new language requires diligence and repeated practice.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>Only learn what you need
              <p> 
                Many educational resources include phrases that you may not use or need. 
                In that case, only learn what you use day-to-day or what you think is useful.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>Take a break
              <p>
                Cramming may allow you to learn many words in a short space of time but it doesn’t mean that you will remember them.
                It’s important to take a break from the language you are trying to learn to allow that information to go from your working memory to long-term memory and find out how much you actually know.
              </p>
              <p>
                Try learning a few words and phrases and then take a break for a while and see how well you remember them. This will aid in making sure that all the new content you learn act
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>Engage with the language
              <p>
                Simply learning a few words of phrases is relatively easy but doesn’t ensure fluency.
                Engagement with the language you are learning is essential.
              </p>
              <p>
                One way to do this is to find a conversation partner to practice with.
                This could be a native or someone who is also trying to learn a new language.
              </p>
              <p>
                You could also engage with the movies, series and music of the language you are trying to learn.
                Find some examples of these here.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>It’s OK to Not Understand and Make Mistakes
              <p>
                It is imperative to stretch yourself when learning a new language.
                Try to use the language you know and don’t worry too much about getting every word right.
                Fluency, and being able to express yourself is more important than accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may not be able to understands some words or phrases but don’t let that put you off.
                Try and guess things you don’t understand from context and look up words that appear frequently.
              </p>
